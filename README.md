# Smart Beogram

Have you ever dreamt about adding a turntable to your multiroom system? No problem! 

But what if you ALSO could voice-control your BeoGram turntable?

_NOTE: This code also enables simple HTTP GET control_


# How-to
In this guide we describe how to accomplish this with a cheap NodeMCU board and a few components.

**Hardware description in the PDF above. (Hardware Guide NodeMCU.pdf)**

**Video demo and guide for putting the code on the NodeMCU and setting up Adafruit and IFTTT here: https://youtu.be/vhII74I_9sY**

# Parts needed:
- The .ino file from in here (Click the green _Clone or Download_-button, and select _Download ZIP_)

- NodeMCU 1.0 (or Wemos D1 mini board - exact same installation procedure)

- Optocoupler 4N35 

- Female DIN plug

- Different wires, depending on how you decide to connect it all together in the end :) Example in the Hardware guide-PDF.
