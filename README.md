# Smart Beogram

Have you ever dreamt about adding a turntable to your multiroom system? No problem! 

But what if you ALSO could voice-control your BeoGram turntable?


# How-to
In this guide we describe how to accomplish this with a cheap NodeMCU board and a few components.

**Hardware description in the PDF above. (Hardware Guide NodeMCU.pdf)**

**Video demo and guide for putting the code on the NodeMCU and setting up Adafruit and IFTTT here: https://youtu.be/vhII74I_9sY**

# Parts needed:
- NodeMCU 1.0 (or Wemos D1 mini board - same procedure)

- Optocoupler 4N35 

- Female DIN plug

- Different wires, depending on how you decide to connect it all together in the end :) Example in the Hardware guide-PDF.
